# **11SE Task 2 2025**
### By Shawn

# **Sprint 1**
## **Requirements Definition**
### **Functional Requirements**
Consider the following elements when developing your functional requirements.

- **Data Retrieval:** What does the user need to be able to view in the system? 

- **User Interface:** What is required for the user to interact with the system?

- **Data Display:** What information does the user need to obtain from the system? What needs to be output for the user?

### **Non-Functional Requirements**
Consider the following elements when developing your non-functional requirements:

- **Performance:** How well does the system need to perform? 

- **Reliability:** How reliable does the system and data need to be?

- **Usability and Accessibility:** How easy to navigate does the system need to be? What instructions will we need for users to access the system?

## **Determining Specifications**
### **Functional Specifications**
What does the system actually NEED to do?

- **User Requirements**
    - What does the user need to be able to do? List all specifications here.

- **Inputs & Outputs**
    - What inputs will the system need to accept and what outputs will it need to display?

- **Core Features**
    - At its core, what specifically does the program need to be able to do?

- **User Interaction**
    - How will users interact with the system (e.g. command-line, GUI?) and what information will it need to provide to help users navigate?

- **Error Handling**
    - What possible errors could you face that need to be handled by the system?

### **Non-Functional Specifications**
- **Performance**
    - How quickly should we try to get the system to perform tasks, what efficiency is required to maintain user engagement? How can we ensure our program remains efficient?

- **Useability / Accessibility**
    - How might you make your application more accessible? What could you do with the User Interface to improve usability?

- **Reliability**
    - What could perhaps not crash the whole system, but could be an issue and needs to be addressed? Data integrity? Illogical calculation? Menu navigation going to wrong places?

### **Use Case**
A use case in software development is a structured description of how a user (or system) interacts with a software application to achieve a specific goal. It defines:

- Actors: Who interacts with the system (e.g., user, external system).

- Preconditions: Conditions that must be met before the use case starts.

- Main Flow: The step-by-step process of how the interaction occurs.

- Alternative Flows (if needed): Variations or exceptions to the main flow.

- Postconditions: The expected outcome or result after the use case is completed.
